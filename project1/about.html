        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            The <span class="highlight">Government of NCT of Delhi</span>, through its IT Department, is committed to
            advancing healthcare services by leveraging cutting-edge technology to improve patient care and hospital
            management. Our focus is on creating and implementing technological solutions that address critical challenges
            in the healthcare sector, particularly in MedTech, BioTech, and HealthTech domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of our key initiatives is the development of software solutions designed to optimize hospital operations.
            This includes implementing queuing models in outpatient departments (OPDs) to reduce patient wait times,
            improving the management and availability of hospital beds, and streamlining the admission process for patients.
            These solutions are crucial for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare delivery in hospitals, ensuring that
            patients receive timely and effective care.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to patient management, our efforts extend to the study and improvement of inventory management for
            medicines and consumables within hospitals. Efficient inventory management is vital for ensuring that essential
            medicines and supplies are always available, reducing wastage, and lowering costs. We are working on developing
            and integrating these modules at the hospital level, providing comprehensive support to healthcare facilities in
            managing their resources effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="highlight">National Informatics Centre (NIC)</span> has already developed some of these modules,
            and our department is focused on ensuring their successful implementation in Delhi. Our vision is to create a
            hospital-based solution that can be seamlessly integrated with city-wide healthcare modules, facilitating a
            cohesive and connected healthcare ecosystem across the region.
        </p>
        <p>
            By harnessing the power of technology, the IT Department of GNCTD is dedicated to transforming healthcare
            services in Delhi, improving patient outcomes, and setting new standards in hospital management. Our mission is
            to ensure that every citizen has access to the best possible healthcare services, supported by innovative and
            efficient technological solutions.
