# Overview  :

#### --> Challenge: Managing patient flow and resource allocation in OPDs , patient admissions is critical in the healthcare environment and managing bed availability.

#### --> Issues: Inefficient patient queuing, bed availability management, and admission processing lead to increased waiting times, dissatisfaction, and health risks.

#### --> Goal: Develop a solution to optimize patient queuing, manage bed availability, and streamline the admission process in hospitals. 

#### --> Integration: The solution should integrate with a city-wide healthcare module for real-time data sharing and coordination across multiple healthcare facilities.

#### --> Inventory Management: Monitor medicine and consumable stock levels, automate reordering, and get alerts for low inventory.

#### --> Data Security: Use role-based access control and data encryption to safeguard patient information.
